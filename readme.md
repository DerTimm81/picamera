# Introduction
In the year 2020, in the middle of the COVID pandemic, I started to play around with the Raspberry Pi 4 and coded quite a bit in Python 3 at that time. However, I kind of lost traction in that due to my busy work and re-engaged in that field in 2023. Trying to keep track of what I did three years ago, I failed to find and understand the code and had to start from scratch. That's why I promised myself to do better and document all I do. And here is, what we are going to do:

## What we will implement
I very much like image processing based projects. That's why we will use the Raspberry Pi 4 cameara module to perceive the environment and detect certain things. I will walk the user through every step, basically starting from a plain "I've bought stuff online"-situation and set everything up with the user.

TODO: Describe the project in more detail.

### Hardware List
Here comes the hardware used in this project:
* Raspberry Pi 4 B module
* SD Card (64Gbyte)
* USB-C Power Supply for the Raspberry Pi 4
* Keyboard and Mouse of the Rasberry Pi 4
* Raspberry Pi 4 Camera Module
* Parallel Serial Interface Cable between the Camera Module and the Raspberry Pi 4

### Software Configuration
We will use the basic Raspberry Pi 4 standard installation (please find details below). During the installation, we will make use of various Python Libraries that help us to achieve our goals. Please find the comprehensive list below. The version of Python 3 being used and library versions may vary depending on the date of your implementation. Please let me know if you encounter issues, so we can resolve it together.
